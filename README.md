## Rules - How to play?

The snake game is a classic and simple arcade game, the rules are therefore simple. The exact rules is up to you, if you'd like to 
add some extra features go ahead! Although there's a minimum of functionality for the game to be accepted. The game should have **one**
snake, starting as one block/unit. As the game starts the snake should start to move, only **left**, **right**, **up** or **down**. 
There's no such thig as diagonals, right? The snake is hungry, and wants food! Add a block/unit to represent the food. As the snake 
collides with the food it gets eaten by the snake. The snake should then grow with **one** block/unit and another piece of food should 
appear somewhere on the screen. The game is over when the snake either collides with itself or one of the walls of the playfield.

## Setup

In this repository I'll provide you with the bare bones of the project, to help you get started! We will use a library for Javascript 
called p5.js. From here on you have two options: You can use an online editor here https://editor.p5js.org/ or you can fork this 
repository and work through github (or just local on your computer if you prefer that.) To fork this repository you click the fork 
button in the upper right corner. This will give you a separate project with the same materials to work with.

In the project you will have a folder called "empty-example" this is the folder you will work in. If you by now have decided to work in 
the online editor you could just copy the structure to the online editor. This folder contains some files, **index.html** and 
**sketch.js** are the only ones we will need to care about for now. Be aware of that this is only the recommended minimal amount of 
files to work with, you can absolutlety add .css files and more .js files to create your own structure.

Using information and inspiration online is the perfect tool when programming, in this case you will probably have great use of the
P5.js library documentation. I will also link some sites below that could come in handy...

*NTI-Johanneberg will post news on their social media to provide you with information about the afternoon we will gather and go through 
code and celebrate your fantastic work! Remember to have fun and challenge yourself, good luck!*

# Johanneberg Challenge - Snake in p5.js

You can test the game at <https://stonemannen.github.io/johanneberg-challenge-snake/public/>

My focus wasn't the front-end or the looks but I wanted to try if I could make it multiplayer without having to host a server.

First time playing multiplayer it may take a minute or two for the game to find other peers.
